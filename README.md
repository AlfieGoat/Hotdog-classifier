# Hotdog-classifier

Hmm what is this? 
It's a neural network trained to classify images 
and understand whether the image is a hotdog or 
not using tf.keras which I then deployed using
a python flask web server to allow a user to 
upload an image, this image is then saved,
processed and sent to the neural net to
predict whether or not it is a hotdog or not!

Please bear in mind the code may be quite messy
I didn't intend on actually publishing this 
project, until someone said they really liked it.
